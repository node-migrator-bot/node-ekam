# ATOK - async tokenizer

## Overview

Atok is a fast, easy and flexible tokenizer designed for use with [node.js](http://nodejs.org). It is based around the [Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/streams.html) concept and is implemented as one.

It was originally inspired by [node-tokenizer](https://github.com/floby/node-tokenizer), but quickly grew into its own form as I wanted it to be RegExp agnostic so it could be used on node Buffer intances and more importantly *faster*. As of the first release, it does not support Buffer instances (yet!) but it is planned to be the next major feature.

Atok is built using [ekam](https://github.com/pierrec/node-ekam).

## Download

It is published on node package manager (npm). To install, do:

    npm install atok


## Quick example

Given the following json to be parsed:

    ["Hello world!"]

The following code would be a very simple JSON parser for it.

``` javascript
var Tokenizer = require('atok')
var tok = new Tokenizer

// Define the parser rules
// By default it will emit data events when a rule is matched
tok
    // Define the quiet property for the following rules (quiet=dont tokenize but emit/trigger the handler)
    // Only used to improve performance
    .quiet(true)
        // first argument is a match on the current position in the buffer
        .addRule('[', 'array-start')
        .addRule(']', 'array-end')
    .quiet() // Turn the quiet property off
    // The second pattern will only match if it is not escaped (default escape character=\)
    .escaped(true)
        .addRule('"', '"', 'string')
    .escaped()
    // Array item separator
    .addRule(',', 'separator')
    // Skip the match, in this case whitespaces
    .ignore(true)
        .addRule([' ','\n', '\t','\r'], 'whitespaces')
    .ignore()
    // End of the buffer reached
    // This is usually only needed when implementing synchronous parsers
    .addRule(0, 'end')

// Setup some variables
var stack = []
var inArray = false

// Attach listeners to the tokenizer
tok.on('data', function (token, idx, type) {
    // token=the matched data
    // idx=when using array of patterns, the index of the matched pattern
    // type=string identifiers used in the rule definition
    switch (type) {
        case 'array-start':
            stack.push([])
            inArray = true
        break
        case 'array-end':
            inArray = false
        break
        case 'string':
            if (inArray)
                stack[ stack.length-1 ].push(token)
            else
                throw new Error('only Arrays supported')
        break
        case 'separator':
        break
        case 'end':
            console.log('results is of type', typeof stack[0], 'with', stack[0].length, 'item(s)')
            console.log('results:', stack[0])
            stack = []
        break
        default:
            throw new Error('Unknown type: ' + type)
    }
})

// Send some data to be parsed!
tok.write('[ "Hello", "world!" ]')
```

__Output__

    results is object with 1 item(s)
    results: [ 'Hello world!' ]

## Testing

Atok has a fairly extended set of tests written for [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha). See the [test](https://github.com/pierrec/node-atok/tree/master/test) directory.

## Issues

Performance has dropped significantly since initial testing and is being investigated (partly due to events emission).
